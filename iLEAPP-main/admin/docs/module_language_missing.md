# Missing Header Translations

This document shows headers extracted from the iLEAPP modules that are missing translations in one or more language files within the LAVA repository. 

## Overview
Headers should have translations in all supported languages. This document helps identify gaps in translation coverage. Headers are listed only if they are missing one or more translations.

Detailed list is available in the [all_data_headers.csv](all_data_headers.csv) file.

The data below is generated by the [@all_data_headers.py](https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP/blob/main/admin/scripts/all_data_headers.py) script.
